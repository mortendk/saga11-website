## a static what...

Saga11 is a system to build static websites.

Its created cause of the need for a light cms where the webdesigner can completely control what goes on and content is just content, and templates are in complete control of the output

The core value is that at the end its just HTML & CSS and we should not ship more to the end user.

we want to make the fastes websites thats possible and perfectly markup/css/js everytime.

So theres no fancy libraries or spa or anything else its just a website - delivering the content as it should be (if you want to)

## Core Values

* Its just HTML & CSS (and a tiny bit of js)
* Build for WebDesigners.
* No Database - everything lives in the repo
* 100% Markup control
* Host on whatever you want
* Lighhouse 4 hundred is a goal
* Everything is a template
* Content is content - you want settings add a new template and use it there
* 100/100/100/100 is a goal everytime

## Tech stack
